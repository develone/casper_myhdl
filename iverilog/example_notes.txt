Waveform dumps are written by the Icarus Verilog runtime program vvp. The user uses $dumpfile and $dumpvars system tasks to enable waveform dumping, then the vvp runtime takes care of the rest. The output is written into the file specified by the $dumpfile system task. If the $dumpfile call is absent, the compiler will choose the file name dump.vcd or dump.lxt, depending on runtime flags.The example below dumps everything in and below the test module.

Example: 
verilog -o my_design_vcd  counter_tb_vcd.v counter.v
vvp my_design_vcd or vvp my_design_vcd -lxt2
